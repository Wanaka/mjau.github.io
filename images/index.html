            The app's end user are tourists who are visiting a city and wants to get information on that's going on in the city they are visiting and getting good offers on shopping, restaurants, day trips & cultural experiences. The business idea behind the app is to have hostels, hotels and other accommodations giving their customers the app in which they have all the information they need for the stay which makes for a better experience for the user.

            I was interning at Toro for a period of four months where I was mainly working on their website to make it more user friendly, responsive and overall improve the layout. I was creating a lot of wireframes before we decided on a specific layout that would suit the website the best. I was also working on a future product (which I cannot show any wireframes off) where I and another designer created wireframes to be shown to the CEO to get an idea of how the website would look like. When I was working at Toro they released their mobile payment app in Norway and I was in charge of analyzing the outcome of the app and I presented data and information from a web analytics tool to the CEO.

            <p>
              I received the 2nd place in a nationwide competition called 'M2M Innovation Awards' which is aimed to all the university students in Sweden and held every year. I called my idea 'Save the Heart' and the idea behind it was that when a defibrillator/heart starter is moved and in use an alarm is automatically sent to the nearest emergency center, where medical personnel can localize the exact position of the defibrillator/heart starter and be able to arrive faster to the scene. For the person who is using the device this means that he/she doesn't need to call the emergency center and can concentrate their attention on helping the affected person. Through built in speaker and microphone a line of communication can be established where important information about the affected person can be given and received, information which can be the difference between life and death.

              Busstavlan is a desktop application which is used to see when the next bus leaves from your nearest bus stop. You can search from point A to point B to get the next route, but if you travel a distinct route very often it can be tedious to type in the same route all the time. That's why you also can create your own customized route which you only have to click once to see when the next bus leaves.
